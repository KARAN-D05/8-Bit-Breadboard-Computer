##  Manually Programmable RAM
- It is an extension to RAM which was only interfaced with the bus
- We can individually store data in any memory cell by manual programming

## Features
- Can be interfaced to the Data bus through the bus interface
- Each memory cell can be programmed manually using the manual programming pins and Address decode logic to access the desired memory cell

## How to use
- Download the [circuit file](Manually_Programmable_RAM.circ) from RAM folder
- Click the download raw file button to save it locally on your device
- install and open [logisim evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases)
- Open the downloaded file in logisim evolution and the circuit will be ready for you to interact with it

## Schematics
- All images of the circuits have been provided in the [images folder](Manually_Programmable_RAM/images)
