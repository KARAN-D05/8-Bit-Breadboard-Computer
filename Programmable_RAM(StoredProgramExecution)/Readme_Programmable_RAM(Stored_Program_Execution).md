## Programmable RAM (Stored Program Execution)
- In Stored Program execution also known as Von Neumann Architecture, we store the program in the memory as sequence of machine code instructions that are
  sequentially executed one by one by the hardware.

## Features
- A memory unit called program memory is used to store the program
- The program is sequentially executed without any manual intervention
- Each intruction is 14 bit long
- The memory can be made as large as possible after interfacing sufficient number of memory subcircuits
- Instruction set is capable of easily accessing any memory cell and performing memory related operations like read and write
