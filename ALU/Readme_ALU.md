## ALU
- Arithmetic and Logic unit is the most impostanat module of the computer as it is the one that can manipulate data and instructions

## Implementations
1) **Logic Gate Implementation**
2) **TTL Chip Implementation**

## Logic Gate Implementation
- It supports both 8-bit addition and subtraction
- It is Made from 2 4-bit adders and 4-bit adders are made from 4 full adders
- Entire logic can be traced back to simple logic circuits

## TTL Chip Implementation
- It is made from:-
   1) 74LS86 -> Quad 2-Input X0R Gate
   2) 74LS283 -> 4 Bit Adder
   3) 74LS245 -> Octal Bus Transceiver
